    <p>Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 5: How To Get FREE Skins And V-Bucks In Battle Royale
Fortnite Chapter 2 changed the game, including a fresh map and new gameplay features alongside the expected batch of new skins and cosmetics.

If you're new to Fortnite or just looking for new threads for your character, you'll be pleased to know that there are numerous ways to get new skins for free.

Not only that, but you can earn free V-Bucks to help fund your new skins from the shop!

So with Chapter 2 Season 5 now live, you might want to grab some new cosmetics.

We’ve put together the following guide to help you snap up all there is on offer – for free.

Here's how to get free V-Bucks and Skins in Fortnite.

Starter Pack
The Starter Pack rewards players with 200 V-Bucks as part of the mega drop sale!




Fortnite Crew
Fortnite's new way to spend in-game is offering players free skins and V-Bucks for $11.99/€11.99.

Every month, you’ll receive 1,000 V-Bucks as part of your Fortnite Crew subscription!

This is in addition to the V-Bucks you can unlock with your included Battle Pass access.

That's right, you'll also unlock the Battle Pass for free.

Also as part of Fortnite Crew, you’ll get a monthly Fortnite Crew Pack, an exclusive bundle of a new Outfit plus at least one new matching accessory (like a Glider, Pickaxe, or Emote).



Twitch Prime
If you’re an Amazon Prime subscriber, you have access to Twitch Prime.

If you’re wondering what that means for Fortnite, it’s simple – the service offers plenty of goodies for the game, including gliders, skins and more.

Keep an eye on Twitch Prime, too, as they’ll often add items without warning.

Battle Pass
This season there is 300 V-Bucks available for the free Battle Pass!

You can earn up to 1000 V-Bucks if you buy the Battle Pass AND you’ll have plenty of skins alongside enough V-Bucks to be able to buy the new battle pass.

Invest now, save later, and keep getting fresh customisation options just for playing the games.

Fortnite World Cup/FNCS
At last year's event, attendees were offered FREE V-Bucks for attending the event!

If you're looking for a quick cash injection, this is an easy way to get it done although it doesn't look like it is happening this year.

Alternatively, the FNCS (Fortnite Championship Series) offers drops and rewards for those that watch the streams.

Limited-Time Events And Cups
Fortnite’s limited-time events are legendary, offering exciting new ways to play alongside coveted new skins.

There are often free skins doled out for logging in on such occasions, like the Winterfest 2019 event that offered fourteen gifts and extra challenges.

Recently, the Operation Snowdown event gave players a flurry of new emotes, skins, wraps and other cosmetics such as the Snowmando and Frost Squad skins.



Players that participated in the Fortnite Community Battles also had the chance to win V-Bucks for placing in the top 20,000.

With Christmas coming up, we're expecting some more events that will allow you to earn new cosmetics.

PlayStation Plus
Ok, this one is just for the PlayStation gamers, but Sony is offering a free Celebration Pack if you’re a PlayStation Plus subscriber.

You can check it out below.
